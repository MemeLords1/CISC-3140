# CISC 3140 Lab 6

## Notes: 
I wanted to keep my github orgnized and not have different Repository for CISC-3140 Labs so Instead of moving it to RepoMeta I stored it here.
I made a Folder called Part 1 where I show the HelloWorld.java that I moved and Edited. Also in that folder is 
How I made the Repository Called Repo from the command line.
I then moved the file into CISC-3140 folder by cloneing and then made a another folder called LAB #6 which I moved the Hello World into and Edited it. 



## Terminal Log Files/Task:

#### Task 1:
I made a Repository with the command line online and I called it Repo which I then make HelloWorld.java
After I push and made the Repository I then moved HelloWorld into CISC-3140 folder which I store all my Labs and homework for CISC-3140. I then made a seperate folder for LAB #6 with git Init and moved HelloWorld.java into it. I Then Edit HelloWorld to print todays date and pushed it to my Repository. Task 1 folder shows the edited HelloWorld plus the Repository I Created.

#### Task 2:
For Task 2 I had to have pratice with SVN in the terminal. 
I made a Repository called Repot2 and put a file inside of it with nano.
With the file I slightly edited it, then I add/commit with SVN
