# CISC 3140 Lab 8

## Task 1:
 * Check if the string you have inputted is a palindrome by returning a boolean value. To run the program you would have to input(word " *the string/word you want to check* " into the command line as explain in the program when you run it. Once you input the command it will either return #t for true if it is a palindrome or #f for false if its not
 .
## Task 2:
* A lambda expression that recursively evaluates a sum of series (i.e. fibonacci sequence) given a number that you have inputted (val). This would then return the sum of series.

## Task 3:
* Create a function that will calculate two numeric parameters (val) and (tos), but only if they're both valid types for calculation (i.e. a number). Use Scheme's syntax and available functions for checking types. My Program would return the calcuation between the two input value you have inputted a numeric number. If you haven't then it would then return a String stating "You Must Enter Numbers"
